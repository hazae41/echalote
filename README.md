### DO NOT USE

This is experimental software in early development

1. It has security issues
2. Things change quickly

### Current features
- 100% TypeScript and ESM
- Zero-copy reading and writing
- Works in the browser
- Partial Meek (TCP-over-HTTP) transport (without domain-fronting)
- Partial and unsafe Tor protocol (with Ed25519, ntor, kdf-tor)
- Partial and unsafe TLS using [Cadenas](https://github.com/hazae41/cadenas)
- Partial HTTP messaging using [Fleche](https://github.com/hazae41/fleche)
- All cryptography use either WebCrypto or reproducible WebAssembly ports of audited Rust implementations

### [Upcoming features](https://github.com/sponsors/hazae41)
- Tor consensus and directories support
- Implementation of TLS for HTTP (which becomes HTTPS)
- Snowflake (TCP-over-WebRTC) transport
