### DO NOT USE

This is experimental software in early development

1. It has security issues
2. Things change quickly

### Current features
- 100% TypeScript and ESM
- Zero-copy reading and writing
- All cryptography use either WebCrypto or reproducible WebAssembly ports of audited Rust implementations
- Unsafe TLS with modified node-forge (thanks to node-tor)
- Partial Meek transport support without domain-fronting
- Partial Tor protocol support with Ed25519, ntor, kdf-tor
- Partial HTTP1.1 using WebStreams with support for chunked transfer and gzip compression
- Support for Chromium and Safari (Firefox needs to fix its WebStreams implementation)

### [Upcoming features](https://github.com/sponsors/hazae41)
- Tor consensus and directories support
- Implementation of TLS for both Tor and HTTP (which becomes HTTPS)
- Snowflake transport support
- More HTTP1.1 features
- HTTP2, HTTP3 (QUIC)
