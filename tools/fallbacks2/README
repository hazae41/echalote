The Tor Fallback Scripts are used to generate the hard-coded fallback
directory mirror lists for Tor.

NOTE: This script is based on arti
(https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti) which is under heavy development
and thus this tool can break at any moment or maybe even not work.

Who needs to run these scripts?

You probably don't need to run these scripts. They are used by the Tor
maintainers to produce the tor/src/app/config/fallback_dirs.inc list.
You might want to use them if you are maintaining your own Tor network,
or doing research on Tor. But small Tor networks should run fine without
fallbacks.

What are Fallback Directory Mirrors?

Tor protects your privacy on the internet by hiding the connection between
your Internet address and the services you use. Tor uses fallback directory
mirrors when it is first installed, to find the rest of the Tor network. It
also uses them when its cached directory documents are very old.

To run:
        $ cargo run --release

It will output two files that is one for tor.git and one for arti.git which
will be prefixed "tor-git_" and "tor-arti_".
